- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m a php-laravel developer, with a moderate experience.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in various web technologies, such as React, Angular, bootstrap, javascript, jquery, ajax, php/laravel and many more, but in this repository, 
  you and I, we can learn more about php/laravel by providing homework that can be helpful to us in general.
  Anyone can provide homework (question), and then we do and then others can make corrections based on their experience, to make our code writing more effective,
  and understandable.
- You're welcome!
